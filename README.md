Steam Workshop: [[ARIS] Remove Stuck Vehicles](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=428094792)  
Requires: [[ARIS] Skylines Overwatch](https://github.com/arislancrescent/CS-SkylinesOverwatch)

Detects and removes all **cars**, **trucks**, **trains**, **metros**, **ships**, and **airplanes** that are confused. The removal is immediate.

Detects and removes all **trains**, **metros**, **ships**, and **airplanes** that are gridlocked. Gridlocked vehicles will be given a chance to resolve the gridlock themselves first. After a predefined period of time (usually within a few minutes), the mod will remove them. This does NOT apply to **cars** and **trucks**. The game removes those automatically.
